  <h1>Augmented Reality vs Virtual Reality: Exploring New Worlds</h1>

  <h2>Beyond the Physical: AR and VR</h2>

  <p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are two exciting technologies that are transforming the way we interact with the world around us. While they both take us beyond the physical realm, they achieve it in fundamentally different ways:</p>

      <div class="ar-description">
        <h3>Concept:</h3>
        <p>AR overlays digital elements onto the real world. Imagine holding your phone up and seeing a virtual dinosaur roaming around your living room, or getting directions displayed on your windshield as you drive.</p>

        <h3>Experience:</h3>
        <p>AR keeps you connected to your physical surroundings but enhances them with digital information. You can still see and interact with the real world, but with an added layer of digital interactivity.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Applications of AR ⚙️:</h3>
      <ul class="ar-applications">
        <li>
          <span class="ar-icon"></span> Education: Imagine students exploring historical landmarks or dissecting a virtual frog in a science class.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="ar-icon"></span> Gaming: AR games can add a new dimension to gameplay, allowing players to interact with virtual objects in the real world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="ar-icon"></span> Retail: AR can help customers visualize furniture in their homes or try on clothes virtually.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="ar-icon"></span> Manufacturing: AR can be used for maintenance and repair by providing technicians with step-by-step instructions overlaid on real equipment.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="vr-section">
      <h2>Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>

      <div class="vr-description">
        <h3>Concept:</h3>
        <p>VR creates a completely immersive and simulated environment. When you put on a VR headset, you're transported to a different world. You can see it, hear it, and even interact with it as if you were physically there.</p>

        <h3>Experience:</h3>
        <p>VR is a fully immersive experience that shuts out the real world. It allows you to explore new worlds, train for different situations, or even undergo therapy in a safe and controlled environment.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Applications of VR ✨:</h3>
      <ul class="vr-applications">
        <li>
          <span class="vr-icon"></span> Gaming: VR gaming allows players to step into the game world and experience it firsthand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="vr-icon"></span> Entertainment: VR can be used for virtual concerts, movies, and other immersive experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="vr-icon">‍</span> Training: VR can be used for training simulations in various fields like healthcare, aviation, and the military.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="vr-icon"></span> Therapy: VR is being used for exposure therapy to help people overcome phobias and anxieties.
