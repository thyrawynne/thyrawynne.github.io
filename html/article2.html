    <h2>Beyond the Physical: AR and VR</h2>

    <p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are two exciting technologies that are transforming the way we interact with the world around us. While they both take us beyond the physical realm, they achieve it in fundamentally different ways:</p>

          <h3>Concept:</h3>
          <p>AR overlays digital elements onto the real world. Imagine holding your phone up and seeing a virtual dinosaur roaming around your living room, or getting directions displayed on your windshield as you drive.</p>

          <h3>Experience:</h3>
          <p>AR keeps you connected to your physical surroundings but enhances them with digital information. You can still see and interact with the real world, but with an added layer of digital interactivity.</p>

            <li>
              <span class="ar-icon"></span>
              <p>Education: Imagine students exploring historical landmarks or dissecting a virtual frog in a science class.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="ar-icon"></span>
              <p>Gaming: AR games can add a new dimension to gameplay, allowing players to interact with virtual objects in the real world.</p>

          <h3>Concept:</h3>
          <p>VR creates a completely immersive and simulated environment. When you put on a VR headset, you're transported to a different world. You can see it, hear it, and even interact with it as if you were physically there.</p>

          <h3>Experience:</h3>
          <p>VR is a fully immersive experience that shuts out the real world. It allows you to explore new worlds, train for different situations, or even undergo therapy in a safe and controlled environment.</p>
