</head>

<body>
  <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science concerned with creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.</p>

  <h2>What can AI do?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Learning and adapting: AI systems can learn from data and improve their performance over time. This allows them to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve problems in ways that were previously impossible.</li>
    <li>Decision-making: AI can analyze complex situations and make decisions based on the information available. This is used in applications like self-driving cars, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.</li>
    <li>Natural language processing: AI systems can understand and generate human language. This allows them to interact with humans in a more natural way, such as through chatbots and virtual assistants.</li>
    <li>Computer vision: AI can analyze and understand visual information. This is used in applications like facial recognition, image classification, and object detection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where is AI used?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Healthcare: AI is used to diagnose diseases, develop personalized treatment plans, and even perform surgery.</li>
    <li>Finance: AI is used to detect fraud, personalize investment recommendations, and automate financial tasks.</li>
    <li>Transportation: AI is used in self-driving cars, traffic management systems, and logistics optimization.</li>
    <li>Manufacturing: AI is used to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and predict equipment failures.</li>
    <li>Customer service: AI is used in chatbots and virtual assistants to provide customer support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
  <p>The future of AI is full of possibilities. Some experts believe that AI will eventually surpass human intelligence, leading to a new era of technological advancement. However, there are also concerns about the potential risks of AI, such as job displacement and the misuse of AI for malicious purposes.</p>
