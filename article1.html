    <h1>Artificial Intelligence: Beyond Sci-Fi, Into Your Reality</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>Remember those movies where robots took over the world? Relax, that's not quite what AI is – yet! Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines that can mimic human capabilities – like learning, problem-solving, and even interacting with us naturally. Imagine a world where machines can learn and adapt like humans, and that's exactly where AI is taking us.</p>
